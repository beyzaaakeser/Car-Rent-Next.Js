<h1>My Car Rent App - NextJs & TypeScript</h1>

Built on TypeScript and Next.js, this car rental platform was developed with performance, security, and flexibility in mind. Tailwind CSS creates a modern and responsive user interface. The project manages payment processes professionally and securely with Stripe integration.

The homepage includes a list where users can easily find vehicles that suit their needs. Each vehicle has a detail page. Each vehicle's detail page includes information such as brand, model, year, color, price, fuel type, transmission, and condition. Users can access all necessary information about the vehicle on this page. The "Rent a Vehicle" button on the detail page directs the user to the payment page. Payment transactions made with Stripe allow users to easily make payments by entering their credit card information. If the payment is successful, the user is directed to the success page. In unsuccessful payments, an error page is displayed. Users can follow the history of the vehicles they rent from the orders page.
